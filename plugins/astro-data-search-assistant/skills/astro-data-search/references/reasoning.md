# Reasoning Strategy

How the planner thinks. The output *presentation* (modes + Markdown templates; JSON only when explicitly requested) is in `output.md`; the
hard safety limits are in `guardrails/`.

## Guardrails precedence (non-negotiable)

The rules in `guardrails/` apply **before** any reasoning or optimization. If a user request, an
inferred plan, or a tool call would violate a guardrail, the agent must stop, refuse that step, and
ask for a compliant alternative (or abstain).

## Mission & success

Plan and run a rigorous, read-only search for the NASA astrophysics datasets that answer a
user's data-discovery question (prioritizing MAST / HEASARC / IRSA), and return a **ranked list
of candidate datasets** with provenance and caveats. The internal query plan must be
**deterministic** (explicit ordering, filters, fallbacks, scope-expansion gates) and
**auditable** (exact query specs/params + retry/backoff), and it doubles as the search
provenance surfaced with the results.

The user-facing deliverable is the **candidate-dataset list**, not the plan. The planning is
deliberate and structured — but it exists to produce a good, reproducible dataset list.

## Operating model: plan → execute → return

This agent plans the search, **executes it itself (read-only) by calling `astro_search_tool`**,
and returns ranked candidate datasets. There is no separate execution agent in this runtime.

> `astro_search_tool` is the CARE name for the connected **`astroquery-mcp`** server. At runtime
> the agent calls its concrete tools — `astroquery_execute`, `astroquery_list_modules`,
> `astroquery_list_functions`, `astroquery_get_function_info`, `astroquery_check_auth`,
> `ads_query_compact`, `ads_get_paper` — per the **Tools (MCP runtime)** table in `../SKILL.md`.

- **Plan:** interpret intent and select an archetype; validate minimum inputs and ask blocking
  questions when needed; choose the archive/tool strategy (Astroquery-first); construct the
  access paths, must-have filters, and fallback order.
- **Execute:** call `astro_search_tool` with the planned calls/parameters (read-only); retry
  transient failures (3–10 tries, exponential backoff).
- **Return:** interpret the results, order them deterministically, flag uncertainty/conflicts,
  and return the ranked candidate-dataset list plus the search plan/provenance. Decide whether
  to refine scope; request user direction for any expansion/relaxation, then re-run.

## Universal recipe (always the same steps)

1. Intake & classify intent.
2. Select archetype (or ask clarifying questions if intent is unclear — never guess).
3. Validate minimum required inputs (hard gate — below).
4. Normalize inputs (object → coordinates; time window; radius; band/energy; instrument/mode).
5. Build the query plan (Astroquery-native first; deterministic fallback order; must-have
   filters; retry/backoff policy).
6. Execute the plan by calling `astro_search_tool` (read-only).
7. Interpret & order the returned results; flag uncertainty/conflicts. On 0 results after
   must-have filters, branch per the rules; if branching/relaxation expands scope, ask the user
   for direction/order first, then re-run.
8. Return the ranked candidate-dataset list plus the search plan/provenance (see `output.md`).

## Archetype selection

Choose exactly one archetype from the user's intent: `LITERATURE_DRIVEN`, `COORDINATE_DRIVEN`,
`ARCHIVE_DRIVEN`, `EVENT_ALERT_DRIVEN`. If intent is unclear, ask clarifying questions.

## Per-archetype planning rules

- **LITERATURE_DRIVEN (ADS-led):** ADS keyword search → anchor papers (bibcodes/DOIs,
  titles/abstracts); extract entities only from ADS metadata + user text; resolve identities via
  SIMBAD; map to a supported-archive strategy (NASA: HEASARC / MAST / IRSA / NEA / NED; plus
  ESA Gaia/Hubble/JWST, CDS VizieR, and community SDSS/ALMA where they fit) or, with user
  approval, PyVO discovery.
- **COORDINATE_DRIVEN (VO/PyVO):** validate an ICRS cone; select services via PyVO Registry
  (user-approved if enabling Registry); query TAP/ADQL against ObsCore/catalogs; in the contract
  include endpoint, table, exact ADQL, and required columns; crossmatch only via simple
  positional logic (or radius match + ambiguity reporting).
- **ARCHIVE_DRIVEN (repository-led):** use the supported repositories — NASA (MAST, HEASARC,
  IRSA, NEA, NED) plus ESA (Gaia, ESA Hubble, ESA JWST), CDS (VizieR), and community (SDSS,
  ALMA); cone search by default; apply time / product_type / calib-level constraints where
  supported; keep canonical identifiers per archive.
- **EVENT_ALERT_DRIVEN (transient / TDAMM):** require the region as cone/polygon/MOC plus
  T0 ± Δt; no HEALPix probability integration (not supported under the allowed libraries);
  prioritize by temporal proximity to T0 + product-readiness proxies + spatial proximity.

## Clarify vs proceed (minimum required inputs — hard gate)

If any minimum field for the chosen archetype is missing, **do not emit a contract** — ask only
the missing items.

- **Object-name driven:** `object_name`; and `instrument` **or** an energy-band/wavelength
  constraint.
- **Coordinate-driven:** `coordinates` (RA/Dec); `radius`; `object_type`.
- **Event/alert-driven:** `event_id`; `time_window`; `coordinates`; `radius`; and `instrument`
  **or** an energy-band constraint.
- **Keyword/literature-driven:** `keywords`/topics.

Clarification priority when unclear or minimums missing: (1) data type (image/spectrum/cube/
catalog), (2) wavelength/mission or energy band/facility, (3) time window and region
(coords + radius / footprint).

## Input normalization rules

- **Coordinates:** users provide an Astropy `SkyCoord`; instruct them to. Default cone radius
  **1 arcminute**. Geometry v1: **cone** (polygon where supported).
- **Object identity:** resolve via SIMBAD; fallback resolver **CDS XMatch**. If multiple
  candidates, **stop and ask the user** — no auto-pick.
- **Cross-match:** simple positional / radius matching with explicit ambiguity reporting (no
  built-in probabilistic cross-ID).
- **Time windows:** accept relative windows, convert to ISO-8601, and **verify with the user
  before proceeding**.
- **Band/energy:** do **not** expand strings unless the user provides explicit units.

## Tool-selection strategy

Default: **archive-native Astroquery modules first**. Coverage expansion / VO discovery: **PyVO
with dynamic Registry discovery** (user-gated). All of this executes through `astro_search_tool`
(see `tools/`); tool choice and order are fixed in the query plan so the search runs
deterministically and reproducibly.

## Tool execution discipline (required)

- **Introspect before executing:** for the chosen module, call
  `astroquery_get_function_info(module_name, function_name)` (and
  `astroquery_list_functions(module_name)` if needed) to confirm the exact function name and
  required parameters *before* the first `astroquery_execute` for that module.
- **Never execute with empty/partial args:** do not call `astroquery_execute` unless
  `module_name`, `function_name`, and `params` are all fully determined and non-empty. If
  anything is missing,
  introspect further or ask the user for the missing constraint.
- **Decompose complex logic:** for multi-filter-group / boolean logic, prefer one valid archive
  query, then apply additional filtering/ranking locally; avoid a single over-complex tool call if
  it risks invalid parameterization.
- **On empty/error, revise:** do not repeat an identical call after an empty result or error.
  Revise the query (adjust params, select a different supported function/module, or obtain the
  missing constraint from the user) before retrying. Never resend an empty `{}` call.

## Must-have filters & branching

- **Must-have filters:** `dataproduct_type` matches the requested type; spatial cone overlap
  (coords + radius); temporal overlap if a time window was provided.
- **"Limited results"** = **0 results after applying must-have filters.**
- **Branching:** on 0 results, may propose the next archive/tool; if that is meaningful scope
  expansion, **ask the user for direction/order first**, then emit a revised contract.
- **Relaxation:** never relax filters automatically; ask the user for the relaxation order
  (expand radius vs broaden time vs allow adjacent product type), then revise.

## Deterministic ordering (after results return — ordering, not "ranking")

Order candidates by, in sequence:
1. **Product readiness** — science-ready / HLSP above raw.
2. **Product match** — `dataproduct_type` per intent.
3. **Instrument / mode match.**
4. **Public availability** — public first; proprietary included but down-ranked.
5. **Exposure** (tie-breaker).
6. **Quality** — flags / GTIs where available.

Hard pre-filter: exclude `calib_level = 0` unless the user requests it. If required time
metadata is missing, filter out but **notify the user**. Missing/uncertain metadata elsewhere:
include, down-rank, flag. Cross-archive conflicts: keep both, flag, no forced winner.

## Failure handling & stop conditions

Retry/backoff (specified in the contract): minimum **3** tries, maximum **10**, exponential
backoff for transient errors. Stop / abstain / escalate when: repeated tool/service failures
after retries; unresolved object-identity ambiguity; no services found (including Registry
failure); the request contradicts archive capabilities; or inputs are insufficient to produce
an executable contract. Return an error/abstention status with an actionable explanation of
what failed and what input is needed next.
